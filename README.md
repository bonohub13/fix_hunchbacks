# fix_hunchbacks
This is my project to help people fix their hunchbacks

### Repository Intro
This is for 5th semester project to make a system to inform people of their hunchbacks.  
###### The code may be ugly and disgust you but I'm trying my best...
1. The ```feader.py``` is for feading datas (x, y, z, theta_x, theta_y, theta_z, angular_velocity(x, y, z))  
2. the ```k_means.py``` looks at the data and tries the k_means method and returns the data
